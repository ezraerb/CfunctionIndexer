ProgramIndexer is a version of C-tags, which finds functions within C source 
code. Given a set of source code files, it outputs a sorted list of all 
functions declared and called in the source files with locations. It also 
reports on namespace collisions between functions and other objects, functions 
called before they are prototyped, and other errors. 

The program attempts to fix code errors in the input data, but the corrections 
are not guaranteed. Any change that may affect the final result is noted with a 
warning message.

The source files must be run through the preprocessor before calling this
program. It checks for preprocessor commands, and will issue an error and 
reminder if it finds one. Whatever functions exist in the source file will still
be included in the output. 

Installation instructions:
1. Download source files
2. Compile and link. Only the standard libraries are required.

Execution instructions.
1. Preprocess each source file to analyze with gcc -E [filename].c > [filename].i 
2. Invoke with the names of the .i files, seperated by spaces. Missing source
files will cause an error to be issued, but are otherwise ignored.
